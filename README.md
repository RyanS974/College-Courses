# College Courses

Notes and code on free College courses, lectures, opencourseware based from MIT, and others such as Harvard's CS50 series.  I currently have just MIT and Harvard listed below, but might add more from the increasing number of free courses being made available online by various sources.

## Contents

- MIT
- Harvard

## MIT

MIT has many open courseware courses available for free.  There are several I would like to go through on the topics of programming, AI and math, but currently I am wanting to go through 6100L Python and CS.

## Harvard

Harvard has a decent amount of free courses in various formats.  Several from their CS50 series are on my list to check out.  The three main ones I am interested in currently are Python and CS, AI in Python, and SQL.
